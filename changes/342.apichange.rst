Added ``add_model_hook()`` method to ``resample.Resample`` that
allows subclasses to perform additional processing while
reusing quantities computed by ``add_model()``.


Modified the behavior of ``resample.utils.build_driz_weight()``: any
value of the ``weight_type`` argument other than "ivm", "exptime", or ``None``
will raise a ``ValueError`` exception (previous behavior was to treat them
as ``None``).
